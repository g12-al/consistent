# Consistent Hash

Consistent hash type for Go.

## Description

Hashing items onto a circle of values.

Paraphrasing [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consistent_hashing):
> Associate each hashed item with one (or more) hash value intervals.
> Interval boundaries are determined by calculating the hash of each hashed item's identifier.
